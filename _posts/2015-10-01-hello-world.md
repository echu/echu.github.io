I started this blog to keep track of various working notes, code, math,
and technology that I've been working with at my day job. I'm hoping
these notes will prove useful to myself, my co-workers, or the general public.

My goal is to collect thoughts about programming languages I might learn (_e.g._, [rust](https://rust-lang.org), [go](https://golang.org), [clojure](https://clojure.org), [python](https://python.org), _etc._), tools I might use, math I might learn, and other technical tidbits I learn along the way.

I am by no means an expert in any of these areas, but my hope is to create a repository of knowledge in order to remember and recall my own journey. In a sense, I hope to "upload" my learning to the cloud.
